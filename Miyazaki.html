                            <p>Hayao Miyazaki is one of Japan's greatest animation directors. The entertaining plots, compelling characters, and breathtaking animation in his films have earned him international renown from critics as well as public recognition within Japan. The Walt Disney Company's commitment to introduce the films to the rest of the world will let more people appreciate the high-quality works he has given the movie-going public.</p>

                            <h3>Childhood & Early Life</h3>
                            <p>Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941 at Bunkyo ward, located in Japan’s capital city, Tokyo. 
                                Of the four children born to his father Katsuji Miyazaki, an aeronautical engineer, Hayao was the second.
                                Japan was severely affected by World War II when Hayao was just an infant. His family relocated to Utsunomiya city owing to the unsafe situation in the capital city after the bombing in July 1945. The bombing left a lasting impression on Miyazaki, who was aged four at the time.</p>
                            <p>Miyazaki started his elementary education at an institution in Utsonomiya city and later moved to various other schools such as ‘Eifuku Elementary School’ and ‘Omiya Junior High’.
                                Since a really young age Hayao was interested in ‘Manga’, a Japanese style of comic. He started reading a lot of these books as a kid and even dreamt of authoring a work of the same kind someday. However, he discovered that he could not draw people; instead, he only drew planes, tanks, and battleships for several years.</p>
                            <p>While studying at the ‘Toyotama High School’, Miyazaki happened to watch the animated movie ‘The Tales of The White Serpent’ and was really fascinated by the actress who played the lead and the film as a whole.
                                Miyazaki moved to the ‘Gakushuin University’ located in Tokyo, where he started pursuing his higher studies. He earned his bachelor’s degree in Economics and Political Science in 1963.

                            <h3>Career</h3>
                            <p> In 1971, he moved to the A Pro studio with Isao Takahata, then to Nippon Animation in 1973, where he was heavily involved in the World Masterpiece Theater TV animation series for the next five years. In 1978, he directed his first TV series,Conan, The Boy in Future (1978), then moved to Tôkyô Movie Shinsha in 1979 to direct his first movie, the classic The Castle of Cagliostro (1979). In 1984, he released Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984), based on the manga (comic) of the same title he had started two years before. </p>
                            <p>The success of the film led to the establishment of a new animation studio, Studio Ghibli (Sutajio Jiburi) founded by Miyazaki, Takahata, Tokuma and Suzuki , at which Miyazaki has since directed, written, and produced many other films with Takahata and, more recently,Toshio Suzuki . </p>

                    <h3 >Views</h3>
                    <p class="lengthText"> Miyazaki has often criticized the current state of the anime industry, stating that animators are unrealistic when creating people. He has also frequently criticized otaku, including "gun otaku" and "Zero fanatics", declaring it a "fetish", and refusing to identify himself as such.</p>
                    <blockquote><q>If you don't spend time watching real people, you can't do this, because you've never seen it. Some people spend their lives interested only in themselves. Almost all Japanese animation is produced with hardly any basis taken from observing real people ... It's produced by humans who can't stand looking at other humans. And that's why the industry is full of otaku!</q></blockquote>
                    <p class="lengthText">In 2013, several Studio Ghibli staff members, including Miyazaki, criticized Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's policies, and the proposed Constitutional amendment that would allow Abe to revise the clause which outlaws war as a means to settle international disputes. Miyazaki felt that Abe wished to "leave his name in history as a great man who revised the Constitution and its interpretation", describing it as "despicable".Miyazaki has expressed his disapproval of Abe's denial of Japan's military aggression, stating that Japan "should clearly say that they inflicted enormous damage on China and express deep remorse over it".He also felt that the country's government should give a "proper apology" to Korean comfort women who serviced the Japanese army during World War II, suggesting that the Senkaku Islands should be "split in half" or controlled by both Japan and China. After the release of The Wind Rises in 2013, some online critics labeled Miyazaki a "traitor" and "anti-Japanese", describing the film as overly "left-wing".</p>
                    <p class="lengthText">Miyazaki refused to attend the 75th Academy Awards in Hollywood, Los Angeles in 2003, in protest of the United States' involvement in the Iraq War, later stating that he "didn't want to visit a country that was bombing Iraq".He did not publicly express this opinion at the request of his producer until 2009, when he lifted his boycott and attended San Diego Comic Con International as a favor to his friend John Lasseter.Miyazaki also expressed his opinion about the terrorist attack at the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, criticizing the magazine's decision to publish the content cited as the catalyst for the incident.In November 2016, Miyazaki stated that he believed "many of the people who voted for Brexit and Trump" were affected by the increase in unemployment due to companies "building cars in Mexico because of low wages and selling them in the US". He did not think that Donald Trump would be elected president, calling it "a terrible thing", and said that Trump's political opponent Hillary Clinton was "terrible as well".</p>

                <div class="marginElement">
                    <h3>Themes</h3>
                    <p class="lengthText">Miyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as environmentalism, pacifism, feminism, love and family.His narratives are also notable for not pitting a hero against an unsympathetic antagonist.</p>
                    <p class="lengthText">Miyazaki's films often emphasize environmentalism and the Earth's fragility. Miyazaki dislikes modern technology, and believes much of modern culture is "thin and shallow and fake".Miyazaki felt frustrated growing up in the Shōwa period from 1955–65 because "nature — the mountains and rivers — was being destroyed in the name of economic progress".Several antagonists of Miyazaki's films "attempt to dominate nature in pursuit of political domination, and are ultimately destructive to both nature and human civilization".Miyazaki is critical of capitalism, globalization, and their effects on modern life. He believes that "a company is common property of the people that work there".</p>
                    <p class="lengthText">Several of Miyazaki's films feature anti-war themes.  Porco Rosso is caracterized as "anti-war propaganda";he felt that the main character, Porco, transforms into a pig partly due to his extreme distaste of militarism.The Wind Rises reflects Miyazaki's "antiwar pacifism", despite the latter stating that the film does not attempt to "denounce" war.Princess Mononoke is identified as a pacifist film due to the protagonist, Ashitaka; instead of joining the campaign of revenge against humankind, as his ethnic history would lead him to do, Ashitaka strives for peace. When characters in Miyazaki's films are forced to engage in violence, it is shown as being a difficult task; in Howl's Moving Castle, Howl is forced to fight an inescapable battle in defense of those he loves, and it almost destroys him, though he is ultimately saved by Sophie's love and bravery</p>
                    <blockquote><q>I would like to make a film to tell children "it's good to be alive".</q></blockquote>
                    <p class="lengthText">Suzuki described Miyazaki as a feminist in reference to his attitude to female workers.Miyazaki has described his female characters as "brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all their heart", stating that they may "need a friend, or a supporter, but never a saviour" and that "any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man".Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly the protagonist Nausicaä.The female characters in Miyazaki's films are not objectified or sexualized, and possess complex and individual characteristics absent from Hollywood productions.Miyazaki "shows a keen understanding of the complexities of what it might mean to be a woman"</p>
                    <p class="lengthText">Miyazaki is concerned with the sense of wonder in young people, seeking to maintain themes of love and family in his films.Miyazaki "fears Japanese children are dimmed by a culture of overconsumption, overprotection, utilitarian education, careerism, techno-industrialism, and a secularism that is swallowing Japan’s native animism".Several of Miyazaki's works feature themes of love and romance, but felt that emphasis is placed on "the way lonely and vulnerable individuals are integrated into relationships of mutual reliance and responsibility, which generally benefit everyone around them". Many of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films present an idealized image of families, whereas others are dysfunctional.</p>

                <div class="marginElement">
                    <h3>Creation process and influences</h3>
                    <p class="lengthText">Miyazaki forgoes traditional screenplays in his productions, instead developing the film's narrative as he designs the storyboards. "We never know where the story will go but we just keep working on the film as it develops," he said.In each of his films, Miyazaki has employed traditional animation methods, drawing each frame by hand; computer-generated imagery has been employed in several of his later films, beginning with Princess Mononoke, to "enrich the visual look",though he ensures that each film can "retain the right ratio between working by hand and computer ... and still be able to call my films 2D". He oversees every frame of his films</p>
                    <blockquote><q>When I talk about traditions, I'm not talking about temples, which we got from China anyway. There is an indigenous Japan, and elements of that are what I'm trying to capture in my work.</q></blockquote>
                    <p class="lengthText"> Miyazaki has cited several Japanese artists as his influences, including Sanpei Shirato,Osamu Tezuka, Soji Yamakawa, and Isao Takahata.A number of Western authors have also influenced his works, including Frédéric Back, Lewis Carroll, Roald Dahl,Jean Giraud,Paul Grimault,Ursula K. Le Guin,and Yuri Norstein, as well as animation studio Aardman Animations (specifically the works of Nick Park).Specific works that have influenced Miyazaki include Animal Farm (1945),The Snow Queen (1957),and The King and the Mockingbird (1980).When animating young children, Miyazaki often takes inspiration from his friends' children, as well as memories of his own childhood.</p>
