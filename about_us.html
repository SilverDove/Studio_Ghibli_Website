						<figcaption>CLARA TRICOT</figcaption>
						<img src="clara.png" alt="Clara" />
						<p>You know her as the leader of the team, but Clara is more than just the force that moved the project. She's also the quill and brains behind those creative and visionary articles you were reading. With her unequalled solemnity and great short bob, nothing can stop her. Not CSS, not HTML and certainly not Javascript (though he tried, and failed). </p>

						<figcaption>Stella Thammavong</figcaption>
						<img src="stella.gif" alt="Stella" />
						<p>The powerful Stella with her blazing glare. She stopped at nothing to take the great monstrous Javascript down. With her forcefull and badass comebacks, she succeeded in designing the fantastic page where you can store all the Ghibli movies you watched and choose an emoji to describe your experience, while choosing the theme that better fits your personality (if you chose the dark one you're an awful slytherin). </p>

						<figcaption>Karen Kaspar</figcaption>
						<img src="karen.jpg" alt="Karen" />
						<p>Karen, you know her as the joker of the team (that's what she likes to believe) but she tried to put her wits to better use by creating this page and worked on the database that was supposed to store the users' reviews (using IndexedDb didn't work out so she had to exclude it from the project). She's quite proud of her About Us page (though she really wanted to make dragons appear, but that didn't fit the theme).</p>

						<figcaption>Nicolas Jatob</figcaption>
						<img src="nico.jfif" alt="Nicolas" />
						<p>Nicolas was the very base of this project. His home page is the first thing you see and it leads you everywhere else, with his great pragmatism and seriousness he designed the footer and header that were the link between the team's pages and work. CSS tried to stop Nicolas but he is too strong to be stopped by it. HTML tried to help, but Nicolas is unstoppable when he puts his mind to it. </p>
