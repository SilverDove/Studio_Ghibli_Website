                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>Princess Mononoke is an animation movie produced by Studio Ghibli and directed by Hayao Miyazaki in 1997. In the late 1970s, Miyazaki drew sketches of a film about a princess living in the woods with a beast, but he began writing the film's plot line and drew the initial storyboards for the film only in August 1994.</p>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p class="lengthText">"Princess Mononoke" takes a close look at the impact of Humanity’s greed on the environment. It invites us to take a step back and examine the destruction of the environment caused by our desire for material goods.  The main theme in “Princess Mononoke” is pretty clear: continue to harm the environment and it will eventually be destroyed.  But the way in which “Princess Mononoke” conveys its theme is what makes it so unique.  In the film, Miyazaki looks at some consequences of environmental destruction and effectively uses techniques such as the personification of animals to argue that humans should have more respect toward nature. One element Miyazaki uses in “Princess Mononoke” to encourage human respect towards nature is the personification of animals. But with the talking animals, Miyazaki is showing us that we should treat nature more like other people and less like disposable objects. With this, Miyazaki is showing us that treating nature with little respect really devalues the good qualities of nature. If we want nature to be as beautiful, peaceful, and magical as we imagine it, we must treat it respect.</p>
                <p class="lengthText">“Princess Mononoke” is a movie that teaches us to be more respectful towards nature.  The personification of animals argues that we should treat nature more like humans, while the ending of the movie tells us that we should respect our differences.  The movie offers us a viewpoint on the way humans are treating nature, and at the end of the movie, the humans nearly go too far when they kill the forest spirit.  With this view in mind, Rocket expresses, “It is true that nature can revitalize, as is witnessed in the finals sequences of Princess Mononoke. Nevertheless, nature can only withstand so much destruction and it is almost too late to save the forest when Ashitaka and San, the story’s protagonists, make their final attempt to do so” (Rockett.) With this, Miyazaki shows that we can atone for our wrongdoings toward nature.  But we better do so soon, because if we wait too long, there will be a point where it will be too late to change anything.</p>
